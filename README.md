# CHATROOMJAVA

My first "BIG" personal project. This is a Server-Client chatroom application. It was originally a school project, where we had to make a command-line based chatroom with public and private messages. I have since greatly expanded on it and added:

> **Server Side**
> - Custom file-based database
> - Logic to interpret revamped Client JSON requests / other requests and new features and commands
> - Database / file managment logic

> **Client side**
> - Login GUI (Swift), *login / singup*
> - Main GUI (javafx)
>     - Actively updating GUI with multithreading and other logic
>     - Button and/or command usability
>     - Other user-friendly abilities

This project was originally in another repository, but I decided to create separate repositories for "BIGGER PROJECTS". The application is now in a functional and acceptable state. I will slowly add some features from the *Goals* list, but this project is not my main focus anymore, as I will start other ones.

> [!NOTE]
> For details about using the application, refer to the [MANUAL](Manuals/Manual.md)\
> I created a short video showcasing all the features in version 1.0.1: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_PUWN49Yo)\
> For details about releases, refer to the [RELEASES](Manuals/Releases.md)\
> The main branch is for releases only. Checkout the feature branch to see the latest changes.
