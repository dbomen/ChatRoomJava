# RELEASES

This section explains the release process for this application.

## EXPLAINED

The release numbers follow a specific logic. Each release is represented by X.Y.Z, where X, Y, and Z fall within specific ranges:
- X: 1
- Y: 1 - 99 (2 new features)
- Z: 1 - 9 (1 new feature)

The next release will increment the Z value by 1, i.e., X.Y.(Z + 1). When Z reaches 9, the next increment will reset Z to 0 and increment Y by 1, i.e., X.(Y + 1).0. In this case the release will contain 2 new features. Work on new features and fixes is done on a feature branch before being merged into the main branch, where the release is made official.

### RELEASE BLUEPRINT

Each release includes:

- New functionality/functionality
- Other minor changes or changes to existing functionalities
- Quality of Life (QOL) improvements and bug fixes
- [MANUAL](Manual.md) and [RELEASES](Releases.md) update
